FBA BUSINESS 101: Testing Demand and Competitive Momentum 

Product: VORA Spice Organization for Cabinets
ASIN: B0DK724BZP
Data Source: Helium 10 (third-party estimates)
I chose the 2 tier sku for this analysis because I wanted to keep a balanced pricing that can help comapre other BSUs and price doesnt dominate. 

Why I’m Doing This
The goal of this project is to figure out whether this product is worth testing or scaling for my Amazon FBA business.
I’m not trying to calculate profit, costs, or margins yet.
Before any of that, I want to answer a much simpler question:
Is this product genuinely gaining demand, or does it just look good?
This project also gives me a way to compare future product ideas using the same logic, instead of guessing or relying on one screenshot from a tool.

Why I Chose This Product
I intentionally chose a product with around 200 reviews, instead of a similar product with tens of thousands of reviews.
A product with 20,000+ reviews has already been successful for a long time. At that point:
•	Demand is already established
•	One or two sellers usually dominate
•	Sales are driven by history and brand trust
•	There isn’t much left to learn about what is improving demand
If I tried to enter a product like that, I would basically have to copy what already works and spend heavily from day one. There’s not much room to test or learn.

A product with fewer reviews is different:
•	People are already buying it, so demand exists
•	But the market isn’t fully settled yet
•	Changes in sales and ranking are still visible
•	Strategy and timing still matter

This makes it easier to test the product in smaller batches, see how it performs, and then decide whether it’s worth scaling.
I also checked that:
•	The product has good ratings, not just low reviews
•	Both the ASIN-level sales and parent-level sales are increasing
Rising ASIN sales tell me that this specific version of the product is being chosen by customers. Rising parent-level sales tell me that overall interest in this type of product is growing, not shrinking.

What Data I’m Using and Why
Sales Estimation Data
This data comes from Helium 10’s sales estimation charts and shows:
•	Estimated units sold per day
•	Listing price
•	Estimated revenue (calculated using units × price)
I’m using about 30 days of data.

This data helps me see:
•	Whether people are buying consistently
•	Whether sales are growing, flat, or dropping
•	Whether demand looks stable or very spiky
•	Whether price changes seem to affect sales
I’m not treating these numbers as exact. I’m using them to understand patterns, not precise totals.

BSR (Best Seller Rank) Data
BSR data shows how the product is ranking compared to others in the same category and subcategory over time.
I’m using 30–90 days of BSR data to see:
•	Whether the product is moving up or down compared to competitors
•	Whether sales increases are helping its position
•	Whether the product seems to be gaining traction or losing it
BSR doesn’t tell me how many units were sold, but it helps confirm whether demand is holding up over time.

What I’m Trying to Learn from This
By looking at both sales estimates and BSR trends together, I want to understand:
•	Is demand real or just temporary?
•	Is the product improving or stalling?
•	Is this something worth testing with real inventory?
•	Or is it better to walk away early?
This helps me avoid investing in products that look good once but don’t last.

Summary
This project helps me decide whether a product is worth testing by looking at whether people are buying it consistently and whether it’s gaining ground compared to similar products.
